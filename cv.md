        let newStr = [];
        for(let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
            let elem = str.charAt(i); 
            if(isFinite(elem)){
                newStr.push("_");
            }else if(elem == elem.toLowerCase()){
                newStr.push(elem.toUpperCase());
            }else if(elem == elem.toUpperCase()){
                newStr.push(elem.toLowerCase());
            }
        }
        return newStr.join("");
    }
    let newStr = changeRegistor("KL899NM,ffghj");
    console.log(newStr);
